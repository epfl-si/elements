notes: |
  This component allows you to display multiple cards side by side, in a set of equal width and height. You just have to wrap cards inside of a `.card-deck` component.
  
  Add the `.card-deck-line` class to the container, when you want to display 1 ou 2 cards only, to add a visual touch on desktop helping readability
  
  Add the `.mini-cards` class to the container to display a row of 6 mini cards.
