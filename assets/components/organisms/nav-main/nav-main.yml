title: Nav main
name: nav-main
wrapper: nav-solid-layout
variants:
  - name: async
    title: Async
    wrapper: nav-solid-layout
notes: |
  The navigation has two different modes: **solid** and **toggled**. To differentiate the CSS and js behavior, we use the classes `.nav-toggle-layout` and `.nav-solid-layout` on the `.main-container`.

  Both navigations will behave the same way on mobile.
