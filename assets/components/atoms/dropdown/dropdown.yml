name: dropdown
title: Dropdown
notes: |
  The dropdown component **triggers an action**. Use it when people need to perform an action in the page. Do not confuse this component with the [select component](#/atoms/select).

  Remember to **keep lists useful**. Clear and short lists are the bests! Long lists slow the decision-making process. If you have few items (2 to 3), use other components, such as a [link](#/atoms/link) or a [button](#/atoms/button).

  **Active highlight**

  to indicate the current item, use the class `active` on the corresponding `<a>` tag
