title: Study plan
name: study-plan
notes: |
  The study plan is a special case of table. The markup cannot be changed and we put in place a CSS Grid layout to display the content.

  Please override the columns width (if they do not fit your needs by using a CSS variable: `<div class="study-plan table-like" style="--table-columns: 1fr minmax(200px, 3fr) minmax(auto, 1fr) minmax(200px, 3fr) 3fr 1fr">`.

  The default behaviour is kept on IE, the content stays readable (the table might be a bit wonky when some columns are missing though).

  On mobile, the tables are scrollable horizontally.
