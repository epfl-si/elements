      The styleguide is Web first. We provide a CMS-agnostic or technology-agnostic design documentation. That's why you will only find components that match web standards. That doesn't mean you can't document your own project. We'll be happy to reference your work from other platforms here! Reach out to us.</p>

    What is the meaning of 42?
  </button>
  <div class="collapse collapse-item collapse-item-desktop" id="collapse-5">
    <p>
      The number 42 is, in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything", calculated by an enormous supercomputer named Deep Thought over a period of 7.5 million years. Unfortunately, no one knows what the question is.
