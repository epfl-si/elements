  This is an example of **YouTube** integration but basically, **you can use any king of `<iframe>` URLs** until you keep the wrapper and the classes applied.
  If you have another type of aspect ration, you can use the corresponding modifier classes:
    - `.embed-responsive-21by9`
    - `.embed-responsive-16by9`
    - `.embed-responsive-4by3`
    - `.embed-responsive-1by1`
