  > The HTML **`<picture>` element** serves as a container for zero or more `<source>` elements and one `<img>` element to provide versions of an image for different display device scenarios. The browser will consider each of the child `<source>` elements and select one corresponding to the best match found; if no matches are found among the `<source>` elements, the file specified by the `<img>` element's src attribute is selected. The selected image is then presented in the space occupied by the `<img>` element.<br>

  We are using `<picture>` in Elements instead of a simple `<img>` to **ensure that every user and device will receive the right image format, size and weight**.

  This page presents all image formats defined in Element and all their related sizes. **This implies implemening a lot of image sizes**, but CMS like Wordpress can easily manage [that logic](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_image_size/).
