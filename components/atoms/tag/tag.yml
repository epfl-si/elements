    notes: |
      Tag input is a specific style for text fields. Usable for search or publishing interfaces.

      This component uses [Selectize.js](http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/). Have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/usage.md) for more information about all the possibilities. You can start using it with the markup below.

notes: |
  Tags help categorise and label content items. They can be clicked (active) or informative (passive). Categories for a news article use tags, in an active way.

  Like buttons, tags have different styles:
  - **Non-link tags**, for informative tags
  - **Link tags**, for clickable tags
  - **Removable tags**, used in editable interfaces
  - **Small tags**, when space is limited
