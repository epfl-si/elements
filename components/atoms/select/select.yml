    title: Select multiple
    notes: |
      This variation of the select component enables **multiple choices**. Again, keep your list to the smallest. Think of having a “select all/none” item when the list is long.
notes: |
  The select component is mainly used in **forms**. Use it when people have to **choose options from a list**. The select component doesn't trigger actions: it stores a choice before submission. Don't use it when the number of options is low (2 to 3). Use the [checkboxes](#/atoms/checkbox) or [radio buttons](#/atoms/radio) instead. Pay  attention to **long lists**: beyond 7 or 8 options, people struggle to make a educated choice. In any case, keep your list below 15-ish items.
