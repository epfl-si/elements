    notes: |
      To handle table sorting and responsive, we use the [Tablesaw JS plugins](https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw). On the current page, if the sortable table doesn't have *arrows in the header*, please *refresh your browser* to allow Tablesaw to initialise correctly.
      To enable these features, you will need to:
        - insert the correct data-attributes (as in the following code) in your html tables
        - Include the styleguide `vendors.css` and `vendors.js` files on your page
        - **after the DOM is ready**, make sure to launch `$ Tablesaw.init()` function
