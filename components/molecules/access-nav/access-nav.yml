name: access-nav
title: Access navigation
notes: |
  Also called **Skip links**, the access navigation has to be the first element in the markup of every page. Its purpose is to help people using a Screen Reader or just using the keyboard to navigate more easily in the page. The links can be used with keyboard shortcuts (accesskeys) too.

  With the access navigation, the user can jump to the section they want in the page (navigation / main content).
